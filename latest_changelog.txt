Changes:

- Now throws a runtime exception if Particle Engine is enabled but out of date (requires at least version 0.5, if enabled).

Fixes:

- Fixed a bug where currently mounted weapon's updated range wasn't showing if no other weapons were available
- Fixed weapons with custom glow effects crashing if combat engine hasn't been initialized and player immediately enters refit screen upon loading a save
