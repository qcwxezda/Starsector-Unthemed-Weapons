Fixes:
- Electron torpedos no longer cause a crash when fired with Particle Engine disabled
- Huge fortified caches now correctly give more large weapon blueprints than large fortified caches
- Stinger Swarm Battery missiles no longer instantly destroy themselves when graphicslib is enabled
(graphicslib issue with missile auto destruct)
- Secret stuff no longer sit at (1000000, 1000000) when hidden, so neutrino detector mk2 users don't go crazy

Changes:
Fortified caches:
- generation code no longer prefers systems farther away from the core
- slightly increased size of defending fleet for medium and large caches
- applies to new game only
Megabloom Projector:
- ammo 10 -> 12
- damage 1200 -> 1000
- added 1 extra secondary explosion
- slightly reduced secondary explosion delay
Void Ray:
- rarity 0.125 -> 0.25
- improved convergence time
- greatly slowed post-convergence intensification rate (takes roughly 2.5 times as long for the damage to go from 5x350 to 1x1750 after the beam has converged)
Chaos Pulser: rarity 0.25 -> 0.5
Needle Driver: rarity 0.25 -> 0.33
Electron-class Torpedo Rack:
- damage to disabled components now varies based on size, now skips decorative weapons
- move speed 350 -> 450
[REDACTED]:
- max charge time 25s -> 20s
- lowered max charge damage
[REDACTED]:
