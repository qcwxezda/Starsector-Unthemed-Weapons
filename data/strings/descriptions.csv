wpnxt_boltgun,WEAPON,"Light suppression weapon with excellent range and negligible mounting overhead. Very poor damage output limits its practical viability.",,,,
wpnxt_mininglasermk2,WEAPON,"More an instrument of intimidation than anything else, its undersized frame can't properly accommodate the long range anti-armor beam it fires. Accordingly, the weapon burns out immediately after internal capacitors run dry, which occurs after just two minutes of sustained fire.",,,,
wpnxt_impactbeam,WEAPON,"Offers modest shield suppression capability at a substandard beam range.",,,,
wpnxt_miniblaster,WEAPON,"Short range anti-armor weapon originally intended for small mining operations. Capable of cracking light armor, but, as is usual for such tools, is dreadfully flux-inefficient.",,,,
wpnxt_boltrepeater,WEAPON,"Generalist small weapon with excellent range and burst DPS, held back by its poor accuracy and sustained firepower.",,,,
wpnxt_voidcannon,WEAPON,"Poorly understood weapon that devastates exposed hull but falters against any form of armor. Some captains have also found success using it to clear tightly-clustered groups of fighters." ,,,,
wpnxt_enhtaclaser,WEAPON,"Although somewhat flux-demanding for a suppression beam weapon, this laser in turn interferes with the target's flux grid, hindering their ability to return fire.",,,,
wpnxt_fragpdbeam,WEAPON,"Offers sustained fragmentation damage that shreds missiles and lightly armored fighters. Has has very poor range for a beam weapon, and significant mounting overhead makes it unsuitable for ships without medium energy slots to spare.",,,,
wpnxt_energyscatterer,WEAPON,"Fires an instantaneous burst of energy bolts that vary slightly in their speed and damage output. Very low accuracy, but performs well when mounted on a hardpoint.",,,,
wpnxt_boltstreamer,WEAPON,"Generalist medium weapon with excellent range, even competing with some ballistic weapons. Struggles against armored targets.",,,,
wpnxt_needledriver,WEAPON,"A mysterious weapon that fires high-velocity energy slugs capable of disrupting shields and ship systems alike. The needle-like projectiles embed themselves into ships' hulls, exploding after a short delay, potentially with devastating effect.",,,,
wpnxt_impactlance,WEAPON,"Essentially four high-powered graviton beams strapped together, this weapon is capable of straining the largest shield emitters in the sector. Unfortunately, despite its larger profile, the tremendous amount of power the weapon consumes makes it incapable of continuous fire.",,,,
wpnxt_boltstorm,WEAPON,"Fires a barrage of energy bolts in a predefined spread pattern. Cheap and flux-efficient, this weapon is ideal for hard flux suppression against larger targets but is virtually useless against armored targets.",,,,
wpnxt_ultrablaster,WEAPON,"Designed to break apart large asteroids, and equally as capable at breaking apart large ships.",,,,
wpnxt_unstablecannon,WEAPON,"An experimental weapon that fires high-power antimatter-injected energy pulses. The resulting projectiles are highly unstable but occasionally deadly.",,,,
wpnxt_voidray,WEAPON,"A massive particle cannon designed to rapidly break apart exposed hull that also puts tremendous stress on shield emitters. Through means not yet understood, it's capable of dealing hard flux damage to shields by harnessing the hard flux of the firing ship.",,,,
wpnxt_minivulcan,WEAPON,"A downsized vulcan cannon with a negligible mounting overhead at the cost of pitiful damage output. Mostly used to conserve valuable ordnance for larger, more important weapon mounts.",,,,
wpnxt_fragcannon,WEAPON,"Fires pellet-laden slugs intended to tear through exposed hull. Lacks the firepower to breach the residual armor of larger ships, but can prove effective against smaller ships. Conversion to point-defense is not advised due to poor accuracy.",,,,
wpnxt_lightpounder,WEAPON,"A cannon that fires superheated rounds meant to tear through light to medium armor. The low muzzle velocity makes landing hits on nimbler targets difficult, and the antiquated reloading process limits sustained damage output.",,,,
wpnxt_lightrailburst,WEAPON,"A modified railgun that fires two-round bursts. Excellent range and shield-stopping power, but low ammo reserves and a slow loader mean that it can only fire eight bursts in rapid sequence.",,,,
wpnxt_minimortarbattery,WEAPON,"A triple mortar system that creates a blanket of low-power mortar shells, intended to stop enemy fighters from approaching. Poor accuracy, low projectile velocity, and terrible range limit its utility against larger targets. Has excellent flux efficiency for an anti-armor weapon.",,,,
wpnxt_heavyrailgun,WEAPON,"A large railgun that fires four-shot bursts, capable of quickly defeating enemy shields. Similarly to its smaller version, it can only fire eight continuous bursts.",,,,
wpnxt_heavypounder,WEAPON,"An upscaled variant of its smaller counterpart in every way imaginable. The high per-shot damage means this weapon excels at punching through slow, heavily armored ships, at least until a reload is required.",,,,
wpnxt_shotgun,WEAPON,"A scattergun intended for close-range combat and later adapted to be effective at medium ranges. Boasts excellent burst damage, but ammo reserves deplete quickly.",,,,
wpnxt_superrailgun,WEAPON,"Fires a massive penetrating rod at an extreme speed. The projectile pierces just about anything, even shields, though the overwhelming kinetic damage is just as likely to cause an overload. A hefty EMP payload ensures the penetration is felt even by heavily armored ships.",,,,
wpnxt_splinterbattery,WEAPON,"A heavy fragmentation cannon that shreds through exposed hull and stresses shield emitters. Sustained fire increases throughput.",,,,
wpnxt_explosiveshelllauncher,WEAPON,"Rounds launched by this enormous cannon carry a devastating explosive payload. This weapon is feared by ship captains for its ability to tear through heavy armor, and doubly feared by fighter pilots for its potential to vaporize entire wings with a single well-placed shot.",,,,
wpnxt_iontorpedo,WEAPON,"Launches unguided torpedoes intended to disrupt ship subsystems over a large area. The effect is largely mitigated by shields. Causes heavy damage to disabled components.",,,,
wpnxt_clusterminelauncher,WEAPON,"Launches a vessel containing three proximity mines that are ejected after a short delay.",,,,
wpnxt_minispiker,WEAPON,"Fires guided rockets that provide light sustained shield pressure. Compensates for its poor damage output with an integrated autoloader.",,,,
wpnxt_energytorpedo,WEAPON,"Slow armored torpedo with an energy payload. Direct damage is poor, but causes several secondary explosions near the impact site that occur after a short delay.",,,,
wpnxt_ionrocket,WEAPON,High-capacity rocket launcher effective against shields and ship subsystems.,,,,
wpnxt_impaler,WEAPON,"Fires a spread of low-yield missiles armed with an experimental guidance system. The missiles will attempt to saturate shield cover by approaching their target from various angles. ",,,,
wpnxt_energytorpedomed,WEAPON,"A launcher for the Bloom-class torpedo. Integration of an automated loading system greatly complicates the firing process. As a result, firing this weapon generates significant flux.",,,,
wpnxt_spikebarrage,WEAPON,"Fires a sustained barrage of high-velocity, low-yield energy missiles. The built-in targeting system is incapable of tracking fighter craft.",,,,
wpnxt_clusterlauncherbig,WEAPON,"Launches a vessel holding five smaller containers, each of which holds three proximity mines. Containers eject their contents after a short delay, resulting in a total of fifteen mines spread over a wide arc.",,,,
wpnxt_orbbarrage,WEAPON,"Fires a large burst of ion missiles that surround the target ship. Although direct damage is poor and dispersed over a large area, the hefty EMP payload can be devastating to ships without full shield coverage.",,,,
wpnxt_energytorpedolarge,WEAPON,Enlarged and enhanced version of the Bloom-class torpedo launcher. Impact causes several secondary explosions over a large area that occur after a moderate delay.,,,,
wpnxt_morphcannon,WEAPON,"""Test results reveal that the semisolid warhead appears to spontaneously crystallize when exposed to the frigidity of vacuum. Whether that constitutes a bug or a feature... is unclear.""","-Unknown, recovered from log files",,,
wpnxt_energyballlauncher,WEAPON,"""Production costs prohibitive. Firing mechanism unorthodox. Vulnerability while charging. The Weaver Project has been suspended indefinitely. Your services are no longer required.""","-Unknown, recovered from log files",,,
wpnxt_phasetorpedo,WEAPON,"""An internal guidance system would be entirely superfluous. For a torpedo of this mass, estimates are that lateral thrusters would grant an effective thirty-degree-per-second turn rate, maximum. I'm no mathematician, but I believe a phase skimmer is roughly equivalent to, oh say, an infinity-degree-per-second turn rate. Now that sounds a lot more palatable.""","-Unknown, recovered from log files",,,
wpnxt_reshaper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates an arcane field that greatly reduces incoming damage, improves passive flux dissipation by 50%, and regenerates the last 5 seconds of hull and armor damage taken. Disables shields and venting while active.",Defensive,"Activates an arcane field that greatly reduces incoming damage, improves passive flux dissipation by 50%, and regenerates the last 5 seconds of hull and armor damage taken.
