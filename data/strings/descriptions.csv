wpnxt_boltgun,WEAPON,"The availability and low cost of this weapon match its lackluster damage output. Still, it has unusually good range for such a small energy weapon.",,,,
wpnxt_mininglasermk2,WEAPON,"An abomination of a weapon. Its undersized frame can't properly accommodate the long range anti-armor beam it fires. Accordingly, the weapon burns out immediately after internal capacitors run dry, which occurs after just two minutes of sustained fire.",,,,
wpnxt_impactbeam,WEAPON,"A downscaled graviton beam. Contrary to its name, it doesn't generate enough force to affect even the lightest of targets. Nevertheless, it's just as capable at pressuring shields as its full-sized counterpart. Has lower than usual range for a beam weapon.",,,,
wpnxt_miniblaster,WEAPON,"Short range anti-armor weapon originally intended for small mining operations. Capable of cracking light armor, but, like its larger cousin, is dreadfully flux-inefficient.",,,,
wpnxt_boltrepeater,WEAPON,"A generalist small weapon with good range and excellent burst DPS, only held back by its poor accuracy and sustained firepower.",,,,
wpnxt_voidcannon,WEAPON,"A poorly understood weapon that devastates exposed hull and does decent burst damage against shields, but is abysmal against any form of armor. Only suited for short range engagements despite its listed range due to its unusual firing pattern." ,,,,
wpnxt_enhtaclaser,WEAPON,"An upscaled tactical laser that is not only excellent at pressuring targets from afar, but also causes them to generate additional flux from weapons fire.",,,,
wpnxt_fragpdbeam,WEAPON,"Sustained fragmentation damage that shreds missiles and lightly armored fighters. Has has very poor range for a beam weapon, and significant mounting overhead makes it unsuitable for ships without medium energy slots to spare.",,,,
wpnxt_energyscatterer,WEAPON,"Fires an instantaneous burst of numerous superheated energy bolts that vary slightly in their speed and damage output. Very low accuracy, but performs well when mounted on a hardpoint.",,,,
wpnxt_boltstreamer,WEAPON,"Generalist medium weapon with markedly better range than a pulse laser, but has comparatively poor performance against armor and significantly worse flux efficiency.",,,,
wpnxt_needledriver,WEAPON,"A mysterious weapon that fires high-velocity energy slugs capable of disrupting shields and ship systems alike. The needle-like projectiles embed themselves into ships' hulls, exploding after a short delay, possibly with devastating effect.",,,,
wpnxt_impactlance,WEAPON,"Essentially four high-powered graviton beams strapped together, this weapon is capable of straining the largest shield emitters in the sector. Unfortunately, despite its larger profile, the tremendous amount of power the weapon consumes makes it incapable of continuous fire.",,,,
wpnxt_boltstorm,WEAPON,"Fires a barrage of energy bolts in a predefined spread pattern. Cheap and flux-efficient, this weapon is ideal for hard flux suppression against larger targets but is virtually useless against armored targets.",,,,
wpnxt_ultrablaster,WEAPON,"Designed to break apart large asteroids, and equally as capable at breaking apart large ships.",,,,
wpnxt_unstablecannon,WEAPON,"An experimental weapon that fires high-power antimatter-injected energy pulses. The resulting projectiles are highly unstable but occasionally deadly.",,,,
wpnxt_voidray,WEAPON,"A massive particle cannon designed to rapidly break apart exposed hull that also puts tremendous stress on shield emitters. Through means not yet understood, it's capable of dealing hard flux damage to shields by harnessing the hard flux of the firing ship.",,,,
