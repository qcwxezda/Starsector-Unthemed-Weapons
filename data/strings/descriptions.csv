wpnxt_boltgun,WEAPON,"The availability and low cost of this weapon match its lackluster damage output. Still, it has unusually good range for such a small energy weapon.",,,,
wpnxt_mininglasermk2,WEAPON,"An abomination of a weapon. Its undersized frame can't properly accommodate the long range anti-armor beam it fires. Accordingly, the weapon burns out immediately after internal capacitors run dry, which occurs after just two minutes of sustained fire.",,,,
wpnxt_impactbeam,WEAPON,"A downscaled graviton beam. Contrary to its name, it doesn't generate enough force to affect even the lightest of targets. Nevertheless, it's just as capable at pressuring shields as its full-sized counterpart. Has lower than usual range for a beam weapon.",,,,
wpnxt_miniblaster,WEAPON,"Short range anti-armor weapon originally intended for small mining operations. Capable of cracking light armor, but, like its larger cousin, is dreadfully flux-inefficient.",,,,
wpnxt_boltrepeater,WEAPON,"A generalist small weapon with good range and excellent burst DPS, only held back by its poor accuracy and sustained firepower.",,,,
wpnxt_voidcannon,WEAPON,"A poorly understood weapon that devastates exposed hull and does decent burst damage against shields, but is abysmal against any form of armor. Only suited for short range engagements despite its listed range due to its unusual firing pattern." ,,,,
wpnxt_enhtaclaser,WEAPON,"An upscaled tactical laser that is not only excellent at pressuring targets from afar, but also causes them to generate additional flux from weapons fire.",,,,
wpnxt_fragpdbeam,WEAPON,"Sustained fragmentation damage that shreds missiles and lightly armored fighters. Has has very poor range for a beam weapon, and significant mounting overhead makes it unsuitable for ships without medium energy slots to spare.",,,,
wpnxt_energyscatterer,WEAPON,"Fires an instantaneous burst of numerous superheated energy bolts that vary slightly in their speed and damage output. Very low accuracy, but performs well when mounted on a hardpoint.",,,,
wpnxt_boltstreamer,WEAPON,"Generalist medium weapon with markedly better range than a pulse laser, but has comparatively poor performance against armor and significantly worse flux efficiency.",,,,
wpnxt_needledriver,WEAPON,"A mysterious weapon that fires high-velocity energy slugs capable of disrupting shields and ship systems alike. The needle-like projectiles embed themselves into ships' hulls, exploding after a short delay, potentially with devastating effect.",,,,
wpnxt_impactlance,WEAPON,"Essentially four high-powered graviton beams strapped together, this weapon is capable of straining the largest shield emitters in the sector. Unfortunately, despite its larger profile, the tremendous amount of power the weapon consumes makes it incapable of continuous fire.",,,,
wpnxt_boltstorm,WEAPON,"Fires a barrage of energy bolts in a predefined spread pattern. Cheap and flux-efficient, this weapon is ideal for hard flux suppression against larger targets but is virtually useless against armored targets.",,,,
wpnxt_ultrablaster,WEAPON,"Designed to break apart large asteroids, and equally as capable at breaking apart large ships.",,,,
wpnxt_unstablecannon,WEAPON,"An experimental weapon that fires high-power antimatter-injected energy pulses. The resulting projectiles are highly unstable but occasionally deadly.",,,,
wpnxt_voidray,WEAPON,"A massive particle cannon designed to rapidly break apart exposed hull that also puts tremendous stress on shield emitters. Through means not yet understood, it's capable of dealing hard flux damage to shields by harnessing the hard flux of the firing ship.",,,,
wpnxt_minivulcan,WEAPON,"A downsized vulcan cannon with a negligible mounting overhead at the cost of pitiful damage output. Mostly used to conserve valuable ordnance for larger, more important weapon mounts.",,,,
wpnxt_fragcannon,WEAPON,"Fires heavy pellet-laden slugs intended to tear through exposed hull. Lacks the firepower to breach the residual armor of larger ships, but can prove effective against smaller ships and fighters. Offers modest shield suppression capabilities.",,,,
wpnxt_lightpounder,WEAPON,"A cannon that fires superheated rounds meant to tear through light to medium armor. The low muzzle velocity makes landing hits on nimbler targets difficult, and the antiquated reloading process limits sustained damage output.",,,,
wpnxt_lightrailburst,WEAPON,"A modified railgun that fires two-round bursts. Excellent range and shield-stopping power, but low ammo reserves and a slow loader mean that it can only fire eight bursts in rapid sequence.",,,,
wpnxt_minimortarbattery,WEAPON,"A triple mortar system that creates a blanket of low-power mortar shells, intended to stop enemy fighters from approaching. Poor accuracy, low projectile velocity, and terrible range limit its utility against larger targets. Has excellent flux efficiency for an anti-armor weapon.",,,,
wpnxt_heavyrailgun,WEAPON,"A large railgun that fires four-shot bursts, capable of quickly defeating enemy shields. Similarly to its smaller version, it can only fire eight continuous bursts.",,,,
wpnxt_heavypounder,WEAPON,"An upscaled variant of its smaller counterpart in every way imaginable. The high per-shot damage means this weapon excels at punching through slow, heavily armored ships, at least until a reload is required.",,,,
wpnxt_shotgun,WEAPON,"A scattergun intended for close-range combat and later adapted to be effective at medium ranges. Boasts excellent burst damage, but ammo reserves deplete quickly.",,,,
wpnxt_superrailgun,WEAPON,"Fires a massive penetrating rod at an extreme speed. The projectile pierces just about anything, even shields, though the overwhelming kinetic damage is just as likely to cause an overload. A hefty EMP payload ensures the penetration is felt even by heavily armored ships.",,,,
wpnxt_minigun,WEAPON,"Essentially two oversized gatling guns strapped together in a needless display of power. Shreds through exposed hull and stresses shield emitters. Throughput increases as the barrels heat up.",,,,
wpnxt_explosiveshelllauncher,WEAPON,"Rounds launched by this enormous cannon carry a devastating explosive payload. This weapon is feared by ship captains for its ability to tear through heavy armor, and doubly feared by fighter pilots for its potential to vaporize entire wings with a single well-placed shot.",,,,
wpnxt_iontorpedo,WEAPON,"Unguided torpedoes intended to disrupt ship subsystems over a large area. The effect is largely mitigated by shields. Causes heavy damage to disabled components.",,,,
wpnxt_clusterminelauncher,WEAPON,"Launches a vessel containing three proximity mines that are ejected after a short delay.",,,,
wpnxt_minispiker,WEAPON,"Fires guided rockets that provide light sustained shield pressure. Compensates for its poor damage output with an integrated autoloader.",,,,
wpnxt_energytorpedo,WEAPON,"Slow armored torpedo with an energy payload. Direct damage is poor, but causes several secondary explosions near the impact site that occur after a short delay.",,,,
wpnxt_ionrocket,WEAPON,"High-capacity rocket launcher effective against shields and ship subsystems.",,,,
wpnxt_impaler,WEAPON,"Fires a spread of low-yield missiles armed with an experimental guidance system. The missiles will attempt to saturate shield cover by approaching their target from various angles. ",,,,
wpnxt_energytorpedomed,WEAPON,"A launcher for the Bloom-class torpedo. Integration of an automated loading system greatly complicates the firing process. As a result, firing this weapon generates significant flux.",,,,
wpnxt_spikebarrage,WEAPON,"Fires a sustained barrage of high-velocity, low-yield energy missiles.",,,,
wpnxt_clusterlauncherbig,WEAPON,"Launches a vessel holding five smaller containers, each of which holds three proximity mines. Containers eject their contents after a short delay, resulting in a total of fifteen mines spread over a wide arc. ",,,,
wpnxt_orbbarrage,WEAPON,"Fires a large burst of ion missiles that surround the target ship. Although direct damage is poor and dispersed over a large area, the hefty EMP payload can be devastating to ships without full shield coverage.",,,,
wpnxt_energytorpedolarge,WEAPON,"Enlarged and enhanced version of the Bloom-class torpedo launcher. Impact causes several secondary explosions over a large area that occur after a moderate delay.",,,,
wpnxt_reshaper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates an arcane field that greatly reduces incoming damage, improves passive flux dissipation by 50%, and reverses the last 5 seconds of hull and armor damage taken. Disables shields and venting while active.",Defensive,"Activates an arcane field that greatly reduces incoming damage, improves passive flux dissipation by 50%, and reverses the last 5 seconds of hull and armor damage taken.
